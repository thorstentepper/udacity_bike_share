### Project Title
Exploring US Bike-Share Data

### Description
The project consists of Python code that imports data from data bases on bike-share
usage in Chicago, New York City and Washington. Several descriptive statistics
are calculated based on user input. The user can decide which city, month
and day to inspect. The statistics illustrate popular routes, times of travel and customer characteristics.

### Files used
The project is based on three csv-files: 'chicago.csv', 'new_york_city.csv' and
'washington.csv'
